### Framework üèóÔ∏è

This is my attempt at a totally un-oppinionated CSS framework that provides everything you need out of the box to layout, align and position the perfect responsive website. There are a few tenants:

1. It must be simple - styles should be intuitive
2. Mixins are the foundation: when possible, classes are composed of mixins these mixins allow you to easily override any existing style or apply a style from the framework to your own CSS.
3. Un-oppinionated: no buttons, no cards, no colours, no fonts. The point is to leave design work to the designer.
4. Utility first mixins, while not strictly "utility first" framework the classes and mixins are generally broken into utilities. This has less to do with a utility first dogma and more to do with the un-oppinionated nature of the framework; most of the actual styling with be in components that you write with a mixture of CSS from scratch and reused mixins from Cardinal.

### Basic Ideas

Everything should start with the `_mixins.scss` file (or associated mixin files as the framework grows).
These mixins power the framework and mixins should be relied as much as possible. This serves two functions:

1. DRYing out the framework code as is the original intention of mixins
2. Building a library of mixins which users can leverage in their custom stylesheets

Mixins can be thought as similar to utility classes in a framework like Tailwind. It is not uncommon in Cardinal to
for a mixin to exist along side a utility class. For example:

`@mixin pad`

```scss
@mixin pad($amt: 0.25rem) {
  padding: $amt;
}
```

`.pad`

```scss
.pad {
  @include pad;
}
```

In such cases the mixin is always the default with the CSS utility class provided as a convenience.
This allows developers to pad their components with the mixin but also use the `.pad` utility in their HTML.

Despite these convenience classes Cardinal is not a utility first framework. For complex components
developers are always encouraged to write their own CSS components either from scratch utilizing Cardinal's
mixins when possible.

### NextJS

This project is using NextJS because it was the quickest way I could think of to spin up a running instance of a site, easily add SCSS and have live reloading eventually I'll pull the framework SCSS into its own repo. Being a NextJS thing you can easily start the development server with this:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Put framework related styles in partials and custom styling in `app.scss` for demonstration purposes. Edit `index.js `directly for html.

### Name

Things have to be called something and Cardinal is the first thing I thought of, it is a red boid that lives in winter trees.
